**Theory:**

Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) is a crucial technology used in solar power systems to maximize the energy output from photovoltaic (PV) panels. It achieves this by continuously tracking and adjusting the operating point of the PV system to operate at its maximum power point (MPP), even in changing environmental conditions like varying sunlight intensity and temperature. MPPT is essential for improving the efficiency and performance of solar power systems. Here's an introduction to MPPT in solar power:

Perturb and Observe (P&O) is one of the most common and widely used Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) algorithms in photovoltaic (PV) systems. It is designed to maximize the energy output from solar panels by continuously tracking and adjusting the operating point to find the maximum power point (MPP). Here's an introduction to the P&O MPPT algorithm.

**Simplicity:** P&O MPPT is relatively straightforward to implement and is computationally efficient, making it suitable for various PV system designs.

**Adaptability:** P&O MPPT can adapt to changing environmental conditions and dynamically respond to variations in sunlight intensity, shading, and temperature.

**Cost-Effectiveness:** P&O MPPT controllers are cost-effective and can improve the overall energy yield of a solar installation.

**Procedure:**

1.	Open MATLAB
2.	From Simulink library browser, pick the following components
  a.	Solar Panel
